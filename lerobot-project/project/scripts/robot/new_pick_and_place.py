"""Ground-up rebuild of the hardcoded YOLO pick-and-place motion pipeline.

Written independently -- NOT based on pick_and_place_yolo_angle.py, per
explicit instruction. It reuses only pure infrastructure that isn't itself
"the hardcoded grasp motion logic" under suspicion:
  - table_ik.py: generic IK solver wrapper around the URDF (no hand-tuned
    pick-and-place behavior in it).
  - table_robot_calibration.json: the table<->robot affine, RECALIBRATED
    2026-08-27 from tcp_offset_probe.py's physical touch-point measurements
    (see YOLO_하드코딩_개발_이슈정리.md) -- this absorbed the real TCP/
    orientation error empirically.
  - GraspPitchModel: reach-vs-tilt fit from taught demonstrations, not
    something invented by trial-and-error hardcoding.
  - pixel_to_table.py: pure pixel->table-cm homography.

UPDATED 2026-08-28: position+color detection now comes from a YOLOv8-OBB
checkpoint (trained today, see YOLO_하드코딩_개발_이슈정리.md) instead of the
original position-only YOLO plus a separate OpenCV Otsu-threshold angle step
-- that two-stage approach turned out unreliable (checkerboard/background
confusion). See ObbBlockDetector below.

All motion sequencing (hover/approach/grasp/retract/drop), safety checks,
and block-angle detection below are new code, written today.

SAFETY, carried over from what tcp_offset_probe.py already validated live on
this robot:
  - checked_solve(): refuses to move on an IK solution that didn't converge.
  - safe_descend(): approaches the table in small (5mm) increments, never
    past a floor clamp derived from the calibration's own measured points.
  - A tracking-error watchdog tight enough to catch a real stall (not the
    very loose values used elsewhere).
  - P_Coefficient raised to 32 on the arm joints -- the historically
    validated fix for gravity droop (see issues log, "servo P게인 32로 상향").

This has NOT been run yet. Read through it, then run with --dry-run first
(no robot connection, no movement), then with --max-blocks 1 before trusting
it with the full run.

# that way for the block to sit between the jaws.
#
# 0.012 is a first estimate -- roughly half a block. Tune from one observation:
# if the same jaw still lands on the block, raise it; if the OTHER jaw now does,
# lower it. Because this rides the jaw axis it stays correct as the wrist turns,
# so unlike a robot-frame constant it should hold across the whole table -- if
# it does not, the problem is not a TCP offset and this should go back to 0.
# Raised 0.012 -> 0.018 after 0.012 left the grasp still marginal in the same

# The second tool-frame offset, along tool_x -- the horizontal axis at right
# angles to the jaws. Measured (and identical at the left, centre and right of
# the table, which is the point of doing this in the tool frame): +1cm of tool_x
# moves the grip 1.08cm toward the TOP of the top-camera image -- and the camera
# sits on the far side of the table from the arm, so image-top is the side
# NEARER the robot. The gripper was closing on the block's far edge (the one
# nearer the camera, which reads as the BOTTOM of the image), so it has to come
# back toward the robot -- positive. About half a block as a first estimate;
# tune the same way as the jaw offset.
#
# Sign in plain terms, to avoid the top/bottom confusion that got this backwards
# once already: POSITIVE moves the grip toward the robot, NEGATIVE away from it.
# MEASURED 2026-09-01 with tcp_circle_probe.py, not guessed. The arm was sent to
# the same point seven times with only the wrist angle changed; the marks it left
# fit a circle of radius 10.5mm (residuals: 0.6mm median, 2.2mm worst), centred
# 9.4mm to the top-camera-left and 4.2mm away from the robot of the first mark.
# That circle IS the offset between gripper_frame_link, which IK positions, and
# the point the jaws actually close on. Decomposed onto the tool axes it is
# -9.1mm along the jaw axis and -4.5mm along tool_x, so the target moves the
# other way by the same amount. Cross-check: the decomposed vector is 10.2mm
# long against the circle's 10.5mm radius.
#
# The earlier hand-tuned values (jaw 12mm, forward 10mm) had the right direction
# but were too big, forward especially -- which is what pushed the grip onto the

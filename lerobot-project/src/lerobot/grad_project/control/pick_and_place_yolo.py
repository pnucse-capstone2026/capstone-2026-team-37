"""End-to-end YOLO pick-and-place FSM for SO-101: single-neural-net (YOLO)
color/position detection + fully hardcoded IK motion control.

  observe pose -> top camera frame -> YOLO detect -> pick nearest outside
  block -> pixel->table(cm) -> table->robot(m) -> IK -> hover -> descend ->
  close gripper -> lift -> move to drop slot -> open gripper -> repeat

Every piece below already exists and is individually tested
(pixel_to_table.py, table_ik.py, table_frame_calibration.py,
yolo_block_detector.py); this script is the first place they're wired
together into a live loop.

Before running against the real arm, two one-time physical setup steps are
required (both raise a clear error here if missing):
  1) Train/download YOLO weights -> --yolo_model_path
  2) Table<->robot alignment -> `save_table_calibration_point.py` (see its
     docstring), which writes project/config/table_robot_calibration.json

Example:
  python -m lerobot.grad_project.control.pick_and_place_yolo \\
    --robot.type=so101_follower --robot.port=/dev/so101_follower \\
    --robot.id=follower --robot.disable_torque_on_disconnect=false \\
    --robot.max_relative_target=15 --robot.max_tracking_error=8 \\
    --yolo_model_path=project/models/yolo_block_detector/best.pt \\
    --max_blocks=5 --dry_run=false
